Bekwai SDA Senior High School, a prominent educational institution, is situated between Bekwai and Asanso on the Anwiankwanta-Cape Coast road in the Ashanti Region of Ghana. Established in 1953 by the Seventh-Day Adventist Church, the school has a rich history of providing quality education and contributing significantly to the community.

Originally, Bekwai SDA Senior High School began as both a teacher training college and a secondary school. The teacher training college, offering a Certificate "A" program with durations of 2, 4, and later 3 years, played a vital role in educating future teachers. However, in 1974, the Teacher Training College was phased out, leaving the secondary school as the primary focus of the institution.

The school has evolved over the years to offer a broad spectrum of educational programs. It currently provides six main streams of study: Agriculture, Business, Home Economics, Visual Arts, General Arts, and General Science. These diverse programs are supported by well-equipped facilities, including a science lab, classrooms, and a library, ensuring a conducive learning environment for students.

Bekwai SDA Senior High School is not just known for its academic prowess; it also excels in extracurricular activities. The school encourages student participation in various clubs, societies, and sports activities, fostering a well-rounded educational experience. This emphasis on holistic development is encapsulated in the school's mission to train students' heads, hands, and hearts, preparing them for service to God and humanity. The vision of the school aligns with this mission, aiming to create a center of learning that nurtures moral and academic excellence and helps students develop careers that fulfill societal needs.

The school's commitment to excellence is evident in its achievements. It has a notable reputation in the Ashanti Region and across Ghana for its academic performance, consistently ranking among the top senior high schools. Noteworthy accomplishments include winning the Ashanti Regional Championship of the National Science and Maths Quiz (NSMQ) in 2022 and the National Cultural Festival (NCF) Championship in 2023.

The school's motto, "LUMEN TUMM FULGEAT," meaning 'Let Your Light Shine,' aptly reflects its ethos and commitment to enlightening and empowering its students. With a university acceptance rate of 29%, Bekwai SDA Senior High School continues to be a beacon of education, guiding students towards achieving their full potential and making meaningful contributions to society.
